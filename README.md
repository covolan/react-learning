# react-learning

## Hi ðŸ‘‹ the porpuse of this repo is to host my projects through my journey of learning react

There are some projects that I've worked on already, mainly I move most of them to the frontend mentor [repository](https://github.com/covolan/frontend-mentor1) when I'm done. When the project isn't from frontend mentor it stays on this repository.

I'm currently working on a CV generator for the roadmap on the project odin. [Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).
